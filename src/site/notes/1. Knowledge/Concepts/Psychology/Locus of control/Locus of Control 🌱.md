Locus of control is a concept in psychology about the degree in which someone believes they have control over the events in their life. 

It is a spectrum between a [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Psychology/Locus of control/highly internalised locus of control ðŸŒ±\|highly internalised locus of control ðŸŒ±]] and [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Psychology/Locus of control/highly externalised locus of controlðŸŒ±\|highly externalised locus of controlðŸŒ±]]. 

Leaning on one side or the other of the spectrum too heavily can be unhealthy and lead you to have an unhealthy outlook on life.
Your locus of control is formed from early childhood and parenting and can solidify into your personality as you get older.
