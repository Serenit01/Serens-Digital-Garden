[The Sovereign Web](https://sovereignweb.thecozy.cat/about/) is a offshoot of the 'Indie Web' and 'Small Web' movements. 
It differs from these movement in one key way. It wants to stay away from the constraints and rules set in place by the previously mentioned movements, without policing or telling others how they should create their websites. 
It's ethos is that there should be no social constructs or codes-of-conduct, where you do not need to conform or fit in with everyone else and can create freely without having to follow rules set by others.

It is a place where "One groups comfort is not prioritized over another group's, "Toxic behaviour is not excused based on who it is coming from or who it is aimed at", there are no "double standards", and where "Everyone is responsible for their own experience" and denounces things like "virtue signalling" and policing of the community. 

Two quotes from the website:
"There are no universal rules of engagement in the Sovereign Web. There is only personal choiceÂ **(yours)**, and the freedom to create, connect, ignore, or disengage as you see fit."

"This isnâ€™t a sanitized space. Itâ€™s a sovereign one.  
True freedom includes the responsibility to self-govern."

It a place that aims to have true 'Free Speech' so long as you are not toxic to others and try to force your opinions on people who don't want to hear them and vice versa.
