Taking notes and placing them into categories limits how you can link them and stifles your creativity. 

If you have all your notes in one place like a [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/The Web/Digital Garden/Digital Garden ðŸŒ±\|Digital Garden ðŸŒ±]], you can link all your knowledge together regardless of the topic. For example if you are studying the law, but you watch a film that covers an interesting legal topic, using the method of a digital garden would mean your notes on the legal issues in that film could now easily be linked to your notes on the law and are not restricted by the category and folders they are in. 

Now you have connected two dots from two completely different categories, film study and law study, and have made a connection that could lead you down an interesting path with more notes!
