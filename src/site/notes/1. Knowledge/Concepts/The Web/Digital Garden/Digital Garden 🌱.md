A digital garden is similar to a 'Second Brain' or a commonplace book. It is a collection of notes that link to other notes bi-directionally to connect all your notes and ideas together.

There are many ways to go about creating a digital garden.

Typically notes are given a stage:
- 🌱 **Seeds:** The beginnings of your knowledge. Small thoughts or ideas that you want/need to expand upon and are not currently fleshed out or well-researched.
- 🌳 **Trees:** More expanded knowledge that now have a lot of other links to more information, expanding upon the original idea. Think of the branches of a tree, they are connected to the main idea, but have branched into their own knowledge.
- 🍎 **Fruits:** Finalized ideas, thoughts or essays that have solidified themselves in your garden and require little to no tending.
- 🥀 **Defunct Thought:** This is one that I personally use, it means that I no longer agree with the content inside the note or have abandoned it for now.

Digital gardens can also help you find gaps in your knowledge and where to go next with your research.
