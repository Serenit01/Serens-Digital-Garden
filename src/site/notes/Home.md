# Welcome
Welcome to my digital garden, started on the 30th of June 2025.
THIS IS A QUICK TEST PAGE

I started this as a place to expand my knowledge and find links between all the things I have been studying or thinking about to make a kind of map of my knowledge! 

Here you will find:
- Notes on things I have read, watched, or listened to and how they have informed my knowledge

> [!Please Note]
> This is not a blog entirely. This is where I will store my knowledge on the different things I learn and study. This is closer to a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) where as I create notes, new connections between notes will form and I can see where each piece of knowledge that I garner are connecting, and where the gaps in my knowledge on certain subjects are! 

One big reason I wanted to make this was that, when you write about the things you learn, you realize just how much you understand a subject. If I struggle to write about something, it means I still don't quite understand the topic, which indicates I need to do more research. And, writing about what you learn helps to solidify that knowledge in your brain as well as giving you a reference to come back to later!

I am starting out small and slow, and I know I have a very small and surface-level idea of most things at the moment, since I am young and have suffered a technology addiction pretty much since I had the capacity to think, but I hope to grow my knowledge as I go along! As my knowledge grows, my opinions and ideas may change, but I will not delete notes. I will just change the name to [defunct thought] or something similar as this happens. That way I can look back and see how far I have come! 
Please note, if I seem to have a surface-level understanding of anything, that's because I do and I am working to deepen my knowledge! This entire site is not to be taken as fact, or meant for anyone other than myself really to give any credence to. The journey to acquire knowledge is something that takes more than one lifetime.

My current interests include:
- Reading (A mix of classic literature and more modern sci-fi and fantasy stories)
- Sewing
- Filmmaking
- Story Writing
- 3D Modelling
- Gardening
- Random little bits of psychology

^ My site will probably start out with a lot of notes on these kinds of things. 

About:
I use obsidian as the writing program for this page. I love it. Also, this page is run using the [Digital Garden plugin ](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/)for Obsidian.

## Get Started
Still confused on what this page is? Here's some more info:

Check out the folders along the left! 
I have structured things like this: 


***Sources:*** This is where I keep all the sources I have referenced in my Knowledge notes. These will really only contain a quick synopsis or overview or the source and some direct quotes that came from that source.

***Notes:*** This is where write all my notes on each of my *sources* that I read. So here I will put quotes AND how I interoperate them, notes on what I thought on certain things brought up in the sources I read and other things that stood out to me. 

***Knowledge:*** Everything in this folder are structured and thought-out notes that I have written on topics after I have done a bunch of research! These are my more solidified notes where, after I have done a lot of reading on a certain subject, I will write down all my knowledge and what I remember about those things in here. 
These notes will be as concise as possible (trying to keep them to under 200 words).

***Musings:*** This is where I write thoughts about things and maybe even questions to myself to look into later


This is how I structure it! So first I will read my source, take notes on it then I will move to solidify what I learned by writing in my own works about a topic that the source brought up. For example, if I did a film study and I noticed that the framing in a certain scene changed the tone of the film, I will take notes on that source, find more sources that tell me about how framing is used in films, then I will link all those sources to a new note that I will call something like "Framing can have an affect on the tone of a film" and write about what I learned from all those sources together. 
I could even then make another note that is higher than that called 'How to create emotion in a film' where I can link the previous note to. 

If you look at the graph on the right, you can see that slowly, as I learn things, I can link more and more things together and it forms a web of knowledge! 
That's the basics of how this all works.
